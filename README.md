# It Follows Mod for Minecraft

*Inspired by the film ["It Follows"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Follows), this mod introduces a relentless entity that will haunt your Minecraft world.*

## Overview

The **It Follows** mod adds a terrifying entity that stalks players persistently, mirroring the behavior of the entity from the film. This creature can disguise itself as familiar figures, blending seamlessly into the environment before revealing its true, nightmarish form.

## Features

- **Relentless Pursuit:** The entity continuously follows the player, never stopping or despawning, and will attack anything that obstructs its path.
- **Formidable Entity:** It is invincible and inflicts significant damage, potentially lethal in hardcore modes.
- **Unavoidable Presence:** Capable of opening doors and gates, breaking softer blocks (configurable hardness threshold), swimming, and invading caves. It can even wake players from sleep if close enough.
- **Customization:** A configuration file allows you to adjust the stalker's speed, damage, health status, sounds, and more.

## Hints

- **Visibility:** The entity becomes invisible in darker environments. Carrying a torch or lantern is advisable, even during the day in heavily shaded areas.
- **Proximity Respawn:** If the player distances themselves too far, the entity will respawn closer. There's a 0.5% chance it may respawn directly adjacent to the playerâ€”maintaining full health is recommended.
- **Sleep Disturbance:** Attempting to sleep while the entity is nearby may result in an unpleasant surprise upon waking.

## Warning

This mod is designed for horror enthusiasts seeking to introduce a sense of unending dread into their Minecraft experience. If the idea of being endlessly stalked in-game is unsettling, consider proceeding with caution.
